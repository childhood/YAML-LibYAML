version: 0.03
date:    Mon May 14 23:27:17 PDT 2007
changes: 
- Fixed Dump call stack bugs reported by vhold. Made Dump work
  like Load.
- Made this very 'Changes' file loadable, and have a test to prove it.
- As a result Load now handles a multiple document stream correctly. 
- Added a 'loader' typedef to the C code. This is kinda like a self object for
  the Loader and maybe I'll expose this to the Perl API at some point.
- Made Dump and Load not be proxy subs from YAML::LibYAML to
  YAML::LibYAML::XS. This removes one level of Perl sub calling which
  should improve benchmarks.
