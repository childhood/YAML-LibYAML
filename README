NAME
    YAML::XS - Perl YAML Serialization using XS and libyaml

SYNOPSIS
        use YAML::XS;

        my $yaml = Dump [ 1..4 ];
        my $array = Load $yaml;

DESCRIPTION
    Kirill Siminov's "libyaml" is arguably the best YAML implementation. The
    C library is written precisely to the YAML 1.1 specification. It was
    originally bound to Python and was later bound to Ruby.

    This module is a Perl XS binding to libyaml which offers Perl the best
    YAML support to date.

    This module exports the functions "Dump" and "Load". These functions are
    intended to work exactly like "YAML.pm"'s corresponding functions.
