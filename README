NAME
    YAML::XS - Perl YAML implementation using XS and libyaml

SYNOPSIS
        use YAML::XS;

        my $yaml = Dump [ 1..4 ];
        my $array = Load $yaml;

DESCRIPTION
    Kirill Siminov's "libyaml" is arguably the best YAML implementation. The
    C library is written precisely to the YAML 1.1 specification. It was
    originally bound to Python and was later bound to Ruby.

    This module is a Perl XS binding to libyaml which will (eventually)
    offer Perl the best YAML support to date.

    This module exports the functions "Dump" and "Load". These functions are
    intended to work exactly like "YAML.pm"'s corresponding functions.

    SUPPORTED:

      * Unblessed hashes
      * Unblessed arrays
      * Unblessed scalars
      * Duplicate hash/array refs
      * Circular refs
      * Scalar refs
      * Empty Strings
      * Undef values
      * JSON true/false roundtripping
      * Blessed stuff
      * Code refs
      * Typeglobs 
      * File handles (IO refs)
      * Regexps
      * Unicode
      * Unix and Win32

    UNSUPPORTED:

      * All known basic types are supported.

    This work should progress quickly so check back often.

BUGS
    There are no known bugs in the libyaml C library yet. The code is nearly
    2 years old.

    The YAML::XS::LibYAML binding is new. Bugs are likely. Please report all
    bugs.
