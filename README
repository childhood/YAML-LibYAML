NAME
    YAML::LibYAML - LibYAML bindings for Perl

SYNOPSIS
        use YAML::LibYAML;

        my $yaml = Dump [ 1..4 ];
        my $array = Load $yaml;

DESCRIPTION
    Kirill Siminov's "libyaml" is arguably the best YAML implementation. The
    C library is written precisely to the YAML 1.1 specification. It was
    originally bound to Python and was later bound to Ruby.

    This module is a Perl XS binding to libyaml which will (eventually)
    offer Perl the best YAML support to date.

    This module exports the functions "Dump" and "Load". These functions are
    intended to work exactly like "YAML.pm"'s corresponding functions.

    SUPPORTED:

      * Unblessed hashes
      * Unblessed arrays
      * Unblessed scalars
      * Duplicate hash/array refs
      * Circular refs
      * Scalar refs
      * Empty Strings
      * Undef values
      * JSON true/false roundtripping

    UNSUPPORTED:

      * Blessed stuff
      * Typeglobs
      * Regexps
      * Code refs
      * Format refs
      * File handles (IO refs)

    NOTE: This very early proof-of-concept does not yet support YAML type
    tags. And perl specific stuff like globs.

    On the other hand, this module supports the full YAML syntax for
    everything else. There are no known bugs in libyaml yet.

    This work should progress quickly so check back often.
